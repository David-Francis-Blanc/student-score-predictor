# Student Score Predictor (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict student test scores based on study hours. It starts with hardcoded data, then evolves into real-world CSV handling, model training, prediction, and visualization.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Trains a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Predicts scores based on hours studied
- Visualizes both data and trend lines with `matplotlib`
- Loads and processes real data from a CSV file

## ðŸ“„ Files

- `ML2.py`: Basic linear regression with hardcoded values
- `csv_plot.py`: Loads data from CSV and plots it
- `csv_linear_predict.py`: Trains a model on CSV data and plots the regression line + prediction

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install with:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
